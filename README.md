This is a project to show local weather to user.

The app gets the geolocation from the browser, talks with existing API (using the freecodecamp API https://fcc-weather-api.glitch.me/ for this) then shows an icon of the weather, temperature and the description of the weather.

This project has been bootstrapped with React. Main functionality in this app is the ability to change between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

This is at this moment a standalone website, but will be in the future be integrated with a full CV website.

At this moment, I have worked 10 hours with this project.
